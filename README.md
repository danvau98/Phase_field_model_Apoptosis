# Apoptosis_Phase_field_model
This repository holds the necessary Python code to generate the results from the publication that relates to this repository. The code is split into two separate files 1. contains the model for simulating apoptosis. 2. additional equations for internal configurational mechanics.

## File structure:
* ### Model:
  - Contains the Python code to run the model using the Dedalus package.
 
* ### Internal_Configurational_Force:
  - Contains the Python code to run the model using the Dedalus package and calculate the internal configurational force.

## Output 
The code will produce simulations as can be seen below, given the right choice of parameter (see manuscript for details).
